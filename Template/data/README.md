# `data` folder 

Here is where you store your data. You can create some subdirectories to organize your data like for example. 

```
/original
/processed
/"whatever you want"
```

I just recommend you to keep it as logic, plain and spaceless possible to make you life easier when you check and read it from R. 

I usually try to reserve this folder for just the original data and then use the [`var`](/var) folder for the processed data in `.Rdata` format or any other format you like. 

If you just download raw data form the Internet or other sources it could be logic to store it here, even if it has been download using R.
