# `output` folder

The output folder is thought to store all the other outputs you don't store in `docs` or `figs`, like for example CSVs for share data, or ESRI shapefiles, or whatever you need to get out that is not documents or figures. 

It's recommendable to create a small description and / or purpose of those files in this readme that could be useful for future reference or to share with others.
