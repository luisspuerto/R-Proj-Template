# `doc` folder

This is where you store the documents related to the project. Mainly the documents that you generate for it, like reports, manuscripts, or other kind of documents for external use or publication. 

You can store here documentation related to the project too. Like for example the bibliography or the manuscript, or papers, reports or so, you are using in your writing. 

Again it's wise to create a logical subfolder structure if necessary, but I think the best is to keep it as simple as possible. 

I usually use a reference manager and store my papers there, or any other reference. So for me this would be juts for the reference file if I'm creating a full markdown document using Pandoc, and of course for any deliverable I want to create. 

Of course you can explain a little bit of each document in here. 

## Doc / folder 1 

- This is important for this
- The source is this
- This document has this or those constrains

## Doc / folder 2
