# TODO

This is the document that states the pending tasks for this project. You can assign tasks to contributors, but remember that @githubname mentions don't work in markdown documents in the same way as in GitHub comments and you need to notify people and link manually to their profiles. If you are going to work more people consider using the [Issues][] and/or [Projects][] sections of your server repo. 

- [ ] Create a more meaningful contributing document for this project.
- [ ] Create a more meaningful contributing document for R projects. 
- [ ] Update the R install from the [README][]
- [ ] Find out from where I got the initial templates and put in the acknowledgments. 
- [ ] Check that the license templates are current and work fine with GitHub.
